Computer Science 250 - Computer Architecture
Homework 2: Assembly Programming

Scores in the Assembly (Code): 107.5/110 (A+).

1. Byseven.s - Write a MIPS program called byseven.s that prints out the first N positive integers that are divisible by 7, where N is an integer that is input to the program.   Your program should prompt the user for the value of N via the console and receive input from the user via the console using syscalls.
2.  Recurse.s - Write a MIPS program called recurse.s that computes f(N), where N is an integer greater than zero that is input to the program.  f(N) = 3*(N-1)+f(N-1)+1.  The base case is f(0)=2.  Your code must be recursive, and it must follow proper MIPS calling conventions.
3.  BuildEff.s - Homework 1 for this class, but in Assembly Language.
